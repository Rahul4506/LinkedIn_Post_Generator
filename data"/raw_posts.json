    "text": "Why LinkedIn and Tinder are long-lost brothers:\n\n- Both can be used interchangeably. You can find jobs on Tinder and life partners on LinkedIn. (Networking *is* key, after all.)\n\n- Both have people posting glamorous pictures at beaches, bars, and fancy restaurants - because nothing says 'hire me' or 'date me' like a cocktail in hand.\n\n- Both have 'seen' and 'ignored' features—on Tinder, it’s your match ghosting you, and on LinkedIn, it’s recruiters leaving your InMail on read.",

Sometimes, they make you fire yourself.\n\nHere’s how silent layoffs work:\n\nYour workload doubles → But your salary stays the same.\n\nYour manager stops responding → Making it impossible to succeed.\n\nAnd then one day, you quit out of frustration.\n\nIf this is happening to you:\n\nStart documenting everything.\n\nLook for new roles before quitting.\n\nDon’t take it personally.
